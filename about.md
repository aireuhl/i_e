### **Resources**

Imperial Eyes is not the first digital or archival project to investigate colonial maps or the rights of indigenous nations within the United States, nor will it be the last project to do such work. 

* [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/), an indigenous territory mapping project from Victor G. Temprano 
* [Native Land's Teacher Resources](https://native-land.ca/teachers-guide/), which asks questions like: how does the modern idea of a ‘nation-state’ relate to Indigenous nations?
* [_An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States_](http://www.beacon.org/An-Indigenous-Peoples-History-of-the-United-States-P1164.aspx), a book by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz
* [Whose.land](https://www.whose.land/en/about), an educational project that pairs the Native Land mapping project with territory acknowledgement guides and videos
