    Asa Wilder is a third generation American who grew up in traditional Osage territory.
    Ariel Hahn is a fifth generation Arizonan and descendant of colonial-era settlers
    who was raised in traditional Tohono Oâ€™odham territory. We both currently reside
    in traditional Tongva territory and are interested in interrogating our participation,
    both familial and personal, in settler colonialism.<br><br>We are also second-year
    graduate students in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA obtaining masters
    degrees in Library and Information Science. <br><br>asawilder@gmail.com / arielhahn@ucla.edu<br>@
