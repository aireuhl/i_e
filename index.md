    alt_text: The above image depicts the Treaty of the Delaware from 1778, a large
      piece of paper that is divided between treaty text and signatures. The document
      is faded yellow-beige in color and appears to have been folded at four points
      as there are creases and wear. In the bottom-right hand corner, there are five
      red wax seals that are tied to some of the individuals who signed this treaty.
  headline: "<strong><em>Project Summary</em></strong>"
  content: Imperial Eyes uses digital tools to engage with the ideological, physical
    and geographic creation of the United States. Through a side-by-side visual analysis
    of historical maps, and a textual analysis of land acquisition treaties, we ask:<em>
    how did the acquisition and theft of land by European colonizers influence the
    way the continent was conceived, envisioned and mapped? <br>What can the visual
    qualities of maps tell us about the role cartography plays in the larger development
    of colonization? <br><br></em>Additionally, using digital tools to draw out deep,
    hard-to-decipher patterns, we attempt to answer questions about how government
    treaties helped shape the way land and space were visualized by early American
    cartographers. <br><br>By creating a navigable timeline of maps and treaties,
    we hope to offer a deeper understanding of the way space is visualized in relation
    to political circumstances and cultural assumptions.

  content: 'As information studies graduate students and future librarians or archivists,
    we are deeply interested in executing projects predicted upon collaboration, accessibility
    and transparency. <br><br>All of the textual data and digital images featured
    within Imperial Eyes are in the public domain. This was an intentional choice
    so that the future of this project is neither owned or controlled by us specifically,
    nor will it be negatively impacted by intellectual property laws. The map components
    of our project, in terms of actual .jpg and .tif files as well as .xml metadata,
    come from the <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/maps-of-north-america"
    title="">New York Public Library’s “Maps of North America” Digital Collection</a>.
    The text-based treaty elements of this project come from Yale Law School''s "<a
    href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/default.asp" title="">Avalon Project: Documents
    in Law, History and Diplomacy.</a>" That online text was transcribed from the
    multiple volumes of <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AKappler%2C+Charles+Joseph%2C&amp;qt=hot_author"
    title="">Charles Joseph Kappler''s</a> <em>Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties</em>,
    a bound collection of United States governmental laws and treaties with Indian
    nations that stem from the beginning of this country. Images for our treaties
    are a combination of digitized pages from Kappler''s text and actual digital scans
    of original treaties, gathered from online digital collections and exhibits by
    the National Archives, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Beaver Area Heritage Foundation,
    and Oklahoma State University. <br><br>We''ve made our .xml metdata, treaty .txt
    files, images, and workflow information all accessible within this site''s Github
    repository. Please feel free to download, experiment and share. '
