    alt_text: The above image depicts the Treaty of the Delaware from 1778, a large
      piece of paper that is divided between treaty text and signatures. The document
      is faded yellow-beige in color and appears to have been folded at four points
      as there are creases and wear. In the bottom-right hand corner, there are five
      red wax seals that are tied to some of the individuals who signed this treaty.
  headline: "<strong><em>Project Summary</em></strong>"
  content: Imperial Eyes uses digital tools to engage with the ideological, physical
    and geographic creation of the United States. Through a side-by-side visual analysis
    of historical maps, and a textual analysis of land acquisition treaties, we ask:<em>
    how did the acquisition and theft of land by European colonizers influence the
    way the continent was conceived, envisioned and mapped? <br>What can the visual
    qualities of maps tell us about the role cartography plays in the larger development
    of colonization? <br><br></em>Additionally, using digital tools to draw out deep,
    hard-to-decipher patterns, we attempt to answer questions about how government
    treaties helped shape the way land and space were visualized by early American
    cartographers. <br><br>By creating a navigable timeline of maps and treaties,
    we hope to offer a deeper understanding of the way space is visualized in relation
    to political circumstances and cultural assumptions.

    within Imperial Eyes are in the public domain. This was an intentional choice
    so that the future of this project is neither owned or controlled by us specifically,
