    alt_text: The above image depicts the Treaty of the Delaware from 1778, a large
      piece of paper that is divided between treaty text and signatures. The document
      is faded yellow-beige in color and appears to have been folded at four points
      as there are creases and wear. In the bottom-right hand corner, there are five
      red wax seals that are tied to some of the individuals who signed this treaty.
  headline: "<strong><em>Project Summary</em></strong>"
  content: Imperial Eyes uses digital tools to engage with the ideological, physical
    and geographic creation of the United States. Through a side-by-side visual analysis
    of historical maps, and a textual analysis of land acquisition treaties, we ask:<em>
    how did the acquisition and theft of land by European colonizers influence the
    way the continent was conceived, envisioned and mapped? <br>What can the visual
    qualities of maps tell us about the role cartography plays in the larger development
    of colonization? <br><br></em>Additionally, using digital tools to draw out deep,
    hard-to-decipher patterns, we attempt to answer questions about how government
    treaties helped shape the way land and space were visualized by early American
    cartographers. <br><br>By creating a navigable timeline of maps and treaties,
    we hope to offer a deeper understanding of the way space is visualized in relation
    to political circumstances and cultural assumptions.
