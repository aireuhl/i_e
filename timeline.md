  headline: 'A linear, time-based representation of the catographic history of North
    America '
  content: "<p>In 1778, the Continental Congress signed the first treaty between the
    United States and an indigenous people, the Delaware Nation. Over the last two
    hundred years, more than 500 treaties, executive orders and acts of Congress have
    since been passed thereby transforming the lived and spatial experience of indigenous
    people within these territories. </p><p>Use the arrows to navigate through our
    timeline and explore the evolution of the visual and geographic representation
    of the North American land mass. Maps are arranged by the year issued and treaties
    are arranged by the date signed. Each map includes the original title, a physical
    description of the size of the original and an attribution to the cartographer
    and engraver. Each treaty includes the exact date, title, an excerpt of text and
    an image, often of a digitized version of the original document. </p><p>All map
    images were originally obtained from the New York Public Library's digital collection
    and are believed to be in the Public Domain. All of the treaty images are attributed
    to the the digital collection they were found in and are believed to be in the
    Public Domain. </p>"
