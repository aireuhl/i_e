  content: This project represents the beginning stages of a much larger-scale endeavor,
    which unfortunately is beyond our current capacity. We believe that more meaningful
    and interesting analytics could emerge through further <strong>harnessing the
    power of GIS data</strong> and building more links between these two interconnected
    datasets (treaty and map metadata). <br><br>With a much <strong>larger collection
    of images</strong> and much <strong>larger datasets</strong>, our analysis tools
    would grow exponentially more powerful.<br><br>Future capture and analysis of
    textual data could be automated using a Python script and command-line to scrape
    text and build .txt files directly as well as geocoordinate location information
    without a GUI. <br> <br>This project would greatly benefit from a partnership
    with an institution that houses a large collection of historical maps in need
    of digitization - ideally, a more automated way to ingest content into our data
    model could eventually be <strong>integrated into the standard workflow for historic
    map digitization</strong>.<br><br>We would love to use xml markup to embed more
    layers of our extensive metadata records into these webpages, and we are very
    interested in integrating OpenStreetMap data to further enhance our visualizations.<br><br>We
    are open to collaborations and feedback. See <a href="" title="">ABOUT US</a>
    for contact information.
