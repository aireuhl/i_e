  headline: "<strong>Palladio: Visualizing Signatory Networks in Treaty Text</strong>"
  content: 'To understand whether or not the treaties within our sample data set were
    connected, we elected to design a data model well suited for network visualization.
    The images to the right of this description and below are all screenshots of our
    data visualized in Palladio. Of the seven treaties analyzed through this web-based
    software, four of them had connections with one another. <br><br>The two treaties
    from 1865 (Treaty with the Apache, Cheyenne and Arapaho, Treaty with the Cheyenne
    and Arapaho) have a total of 20 common signatories. This isn''t much of a surprise
    as two of the three tribes across the two documents are the same, so there was
    a high-likelihood that we''d find connections between them from the outset. Somewhat
    more surprisingly, the Treaty with the Wyandot (1785) and the Treaty with the
    Six Nations (1784) have five signatories in common. Each of the common signatories
    belongs to a representative of the United States government. This means that elected
    officials and government employees of the era commonly worked with multiple tribes
    and indigenous nations to construct treaty documents and redefine where the United
    States began and ended. <br><br>Future instantiations of this project would benefit
    from a broader data set. Imagine what connections might exist if we were able
    to build a network analysis of 200 or 300 treaties? What would that reveal about
    the relationships and rights present within them? <br><br>Even further, how could
    these networks be visualized if we paired this information with the accompanying
    geocoordinates where each treaty was signed? Would we learn new things about how
    these treaties potentially impact cartography or how cartography impacted the
    treaties? '

  headline: "<strong>Map Warper and Google Earth: Comparative Visual Analysis of Geographic
    Representations</strong>"
  content: Using New York Public Library's Map Warper interface, historic maps were
    "rectified" with current geo-spatial data. These rectified maps were then exported
    into a shared Google Earth Pro folder. Transparency sliders allow users to seamlessly
    alternate between visual representations of the "same" physical space. How did
    the shape and character of the land evolve over time in these representations?
    How does the edge of the map effect the way we perceive space?<br><br>These images
    document the working prototype for this visualization. Due to limitations in Google
    Earth interoperability, these visualizations are currently inaccessible through
    the web.
